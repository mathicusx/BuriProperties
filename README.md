This Project uses .Net As WebApi, SQL for my Database, and Angular for the FrontEnd part.
the purpose of this application is for users to list their properties for selling or renting.
there are still more issues i have with the project but the general part of it is working.

How to start project:
1.CD/Frontend/WebApi
2. run the WebApi(BackEnd) by doing dotnet run.
3.CD/FrontEnd
4. Run the the project by doing: ng server or ng s
the project is on localhost:4200 for now, I will deploy it later down the line when i implement more features.
